# MFSlideUpMenu
Slide up menu to use for 'more' in a UITabBar

`MFSlideUpTab` is where all of the tab work is done, you should only have to change 'more index'

`LabelView` is where the view is actually rendered.

I was using it in an application I was creating for class. This is more of a proof of concept rather than an actual reusable element, but by all means go ahead and reuse it!
